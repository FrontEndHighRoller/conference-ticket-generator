## 👀 Why This Project Stands Out

- Drag & drop avatar upload with live preview  
- Strong client-side form validation (name, email, GitHub username)  
- Dynamic ticket generation with a unique ticket number  
- Avatar persistence using `localStorage`  
- Fully responsive, mobile-first design  
- Advanced CSS styling with custom properties & layered visuals

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Implementing **drag-and-drop file uploads**
- Using the **FileReader API** for live image previews
- Writing **robust regex-based form validation**
- Managing UI state without frameworks
- Structuring scalable, maintainable CSS
- Creating smooth UX transitions using class toggling
- Persisting user data with **localStorage**

> 📌 This project was built as part of a **Frontend Mentor challenge**, helping me strengthen real-world frontend problem-solving skills and attention to UI/UX details.
